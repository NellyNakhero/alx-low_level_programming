PID & PPID
A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid):

<h2>execve </h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; execv() system call  loads a new program into the process memory <br/> -the existing process is discarded <br/> -the newly created process  gets all stack data and heap <br/> -since it replaces the processe's memory the return value is always -1 <br/> <br/> <b> Parameters</b> <br/> <i> execve(pathname,argv,env_list) </i> Note: argv and env_list parameters are array of pointers </p>
